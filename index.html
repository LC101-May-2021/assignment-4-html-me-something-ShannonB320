            <h2>"Enthusiast" and "collector" are words that come close, but what can truly describe being an Adult Fan of Lego?</h2>
            <p>As a younger kid, most of my exposure to Lego building bricks came through my brother Tony. He was five years older and could be trusted with smaller choke-hazard type toys. Nonetheless, his fervor for building meant Tony and I spent many days together building Lego cities and scenes. Now, even as I’ve gotten older, I haven’t lost my love I have for building. Thus, I have joined the community of “Adult Fans of Lego” (or AFOL).</p>

            <h2>What is there besides blocks?</h2>
            <p>The Lego community is strong, especially online. The Lego website itself has A COMMUNITY BOARD where Lego fans can collaborate. There are also dedicated websites (like BRICKLINK, for instance) for fans of Lego to buy/sell/trade parts and share their own original designs. The fun doesn’t stay virtual, though! Recently Fox’s LEGO MASTERS premiered, where teams compete to see if their mega-sized builds can hold up to various tests. Worldwide there are 27 Lego Discovery Centers where visitors can see life-size Lego sculptures and participate in themed activities for all ages. Every year there are dozens of fan expos and conventions well as the official annual LEGO(R) CON. </p>

            <h2>So you're just following instructions?</h2>
            <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the AFOL community is “alternate builds.” These are creative constructions that take a branded Lego set and use the pieces to make something entirely new. Other artists challenge themselves to create completely original Lego builds, including assembling entire cities! Though I haven’t made the jump into these challenges yet, I do enjoy taking a pile of pieces and forming them into something spectacular. Below are a few photos of recent builds I’ve put together.</p>
