            <h2 id="mainHeading">Starting Small...</h2>
            <p>As a kid, I played with LEGO building bricks alongside my brother. The hobby never died as I grew into adulthood. Even now I challenge my creativity and create new and unique structures with the help of LEGO. </p>
            <h2 id="mainHeading">...and Building Up!</h2>
            <p>Below are a series of builds I've completed in the past few years. They range in size and dofficulty, though they each have something special.</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">Buildable Brick</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\01 V Red Lego Brick.jpg" alt="Buildable Brick" title="A brick made of bricks!" height="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This is a small set that LEGO gave out to customers as a promotional item. They are available in several colors and this one is the classic 2x4 Red Brick. It's a simple build, but charming!</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">Amelia Earhart</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\02 H Amelia Earhart.jpg" alt="Amelia Earhart" title="A small replica of a big trailblazer." width="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This set was also a promotional item and actually replicates the exhibit of Amelia Earhart in the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. It was released during the celebration of International Women's Day 2021.</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">Bonsai Tree</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\03 H Bonsai Tree.jpg" alt="Bonsai Tree" title="These leaves change with the season!" width="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This set is from the project line designed especially for adults: Creator Expert. It comes with 2 possible builds: green leaves for summer or pink leaves for spring. My favorite quirk of this set is that the cherry blossoms are made using 101 of the LEGO frog piece, molded using pink plastic instead of green.</p>
               
               <h3 class="buildTitle">D-O</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\04 V D-O.jpg" alt="D-O" title="Droids are a human's best friend!" height="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This set is a sculpture of a new droid character that debuted in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. To replicate the droid, this build has lots of moving parts including posable antennae and a head that tilts and spins.</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">Volkswagen Beetle</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\05 H VW Beetle.jpg" alt="Volkswagen Beetle" title="Surf's up!" width="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This set is just one in a series LEGO produces of classic car models. This one is inspired by VW Beetles in the 1960's with working doors, wheels, mirrors, and seats as well as a trunk you can pack with items ready for a beach trip!</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">Dinosaur Fossils</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\06 H Dinosaur Fossils.jpg" alt="Dinosaur Fossils" title="Fossilized Lego sapiens for scale." width="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This set displays museum-style builds of a Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops, and Pteranodon built in a 1:32 scale to the real deal. While it is called "Dinosaur Fossils," it <em>technically</em> makes 2 dinosaurs and 1 pterosaur reptile... but who's counting?</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">The Upside Down</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\07 H Upside Down.jpg" alt="The Upside Down" title="Roll for initiative!" width="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">If you are familiar with the Netflix original series <em>Stranger Things</em>, you will already recognize this set! This unique scene depicts Hawkins, Indiana above and the terrifying Upside Down below. Once built, the model can fully flip over and be displayed with either scene on top.</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">Haunted House</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\08 H Haunted House.jpg" alt="Haunted House" title="BOO!" width="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This is one of my favorite sets! The Haunted House opens up with eclectic details inside and out. Along with a spooky cast of characters, it depicts a scary, free&#8209;falling amusement park ride that lets your minifigs travel up the central elevator and them plummet back to Earth.</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">Diagon Alley</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\09 H Diagon Alley.jpg" alt="Diagon Alley" title="Have a stay at the Leaky Cauldron!" width="400px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This set is a 4&#8209;part build that brings the various businesses and characters of <em>Harry Potter</em> to life. Displayed here are the front facades of each Diagon Alley store, but behind each are full interiors as well. This is my second-largest set at 5,544 pieces.</p>

               <h3 class="buildTitle">Hogwarts Castle</h3>
               <div class="image">
                  <img src="images\10 H Hogwarts.jpg" alt="Hogwarts Castle" title="Yer a wizard, Harry!" width="700px">
               </div>
               <p class="buildDescription">This set truly replicates the magic of <em>Harry Potter</em>. Just this one build incorporates scenes and characters from all seven books and is fully playable on the inside as well. It features the Great Hall, moving staircases, Hagrid's hut, Chamber of Secrets, Umbridge's office, and more! This is my largest set at 6,020 pieces and comes with 4 minifigures and 27 microfigures (so that the people are the same scale as the castle!).</p>

            <h2 id="mainHeading">What's Next?</h2>
            <p>This course at LaunchCode has inspired my next build to be the LEGO&#174;BOOST Creative Toolbox, which involves building a robot and coding a program to give that robot functionality. While there are always new sets releasing from official LEGO designers, the creativity doesn't end there! A huge part of the LEGO community is creating alternate and original builds that don't come in a box... something I definitely want to try one day!</p>
